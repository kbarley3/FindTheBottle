# FindTheBottle
PoisonSoda.java: works by essentially spliting the range of possibly poisoned bottles into chunks determined by the available negative test strips. As it finds the poisoned bottle it shortens the range of possibly poisoned bottles. Once the bounds per test strips is only 1, meaning one drop per test strip, or the elements per chunk is 0, meaning there are more test strips than bottles to test, it tests each one individually and returns the result if the poison bottle is found. The poison bottle is found within either 21 days or 28 days.
